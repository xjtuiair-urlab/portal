    <h2 class="content-title">Embodied AI</h2>
    
    <p>
        As artificial intelligence systems increasingly interact with the physical world, 
        the field of Embodied AI focuses on developing agents that can perceive, reason, 
        and act within dynamic environments. Moving beyond static datasets, it tackles the 
        core challenge of integrating sensory understanding with physical action to achieve 
        complex tasks. Covering areas from robotic navigation to interactive task completion, 
        our core exploration centers on building intelligent systems that learn from and adapt 
        to the real world through embodied experiences.

    <h3 class="content-title">Vision-Language-Action Models</h3>

    <p>
        The integration of vision, language, and action represents a frontier in creating generalist 
        robotic agents. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are challenged by the need to ground 
        linguistic instructions and visual perception into precise, sequential physical actions. 
        Spanning the domains of multimodal learning, robot control, and real-world deployment, our 
        key work involves developing unified models that translate high-level commands into adaptive and safe robotic behaviors.

    <h2 class="content-title">Emerging Computing Architecture</h2>

    <p>
        As the traditional von Neumann architecture faces severe bottlenecks due to the "memory wall" 
        and "power wall," emerging compute architectures, such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and 
        Computing-in-Memory (CIM), have become a pivotal paradigm shift in modern integrated circuits.
    </p>

    <h3 class="content-title">Computing-in-Memory (CIM) Architecture</h3>

    <p>
        To break the "memory wall" that plagues data movement between separate processing and memory units, 
        Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architecture emerges as a paradigm-shifting solution. It is challenged by 
        the design of reliable, high-density, and non-volatile memory devices capable of performing analog 
        computations in-place. Covering material science, circuit design, and architecture innovation, our 
        major thrust is on realizing CIM systems that drastically accelerate core operations like matrix-vector 
        multiplication for next-generation AI hardware.

    <h2 class="content-title">Efficient AI</h2>

    <p>
        As state-of-the-art AI models grow exponentially in size and resource requirements, their deployment in 
        real-world, resource-constrained settings becomes profoundly difficult. Efficient AI addresses the critical 
        challenge of maximizing model performance while minimizing computational cost, energy consumption, and memory 
        footprint. Spanning techniques from algorithm design to hardware-aware optimization, our central mission is 
        to develop methodologies that make advanced AI capabilities accessible, sustainable, and scalable.

    <h3 class="content-title">Model and Dataset Distillation</h3>

    <p>
        In response to the prohibitive cost of training and deploying massive models on enormous datasets, distillation 
        techniques aim to capture essential knowledge into compact forms. Model and Dataset Distillation is challenged 
        by efficiently transferring the capabilities of a large "teacher" network into a small "student" or synthesizing 
        a small, informative dataset that preserves the utility of a large original one. Covering knowledge transfer, 
        core-set selection, and synthetic data generation, our key achievement lies in creating highly portable and 
        efficient representations that maintain high task performance.
